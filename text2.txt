This is the second file on reflections.

What happens when I initialize a repository?
Git starts tracking versions, I think. But that happens only when I commit a file.

Working directory is the directory of interest. Files there may be untracked
or in the staging area.

Respository is where all the committed files are placed.

Staging area is where the files have been added. They have not been committed as yet.

What happens when I initialize a repository?
Git starts tracking versions, I think. But that happens only when I commit a file.

Working directory is the directory of interest. Files there may be untracked
or in the staging area.

Respository is where all the committed files are placed.

Staging area is where the files have been added. They have not been committed as yet.

How to use the staging are to make sure there is just one logical change per commit?
Make change. Commit. Compare staging area with the working directory. Make sure that
there is just one change.

How are branches useful?
Branches help experiment with new features, change features. It helps to break stuff
without taking a risk that all the work done to date will be lost.

How do the diagrams help you visualize?
Diagrams can help visualize which are the different branches, and where each branch is
in terms of features added or changed.

Merging files
Merging files is a good way to combine two branches.

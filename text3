This is the third reflection file. It is created directly on github. I will later download this file
on to my computer.

I think that github is an excellent cloud service. Just like it has become an indispensible tool for
collaborating when programming, I hope that tools come up for other industries as well. In many 
industries, such as banking and law, we still have word files being emailed back and forth. That's a waste.
And it is space inefficient solution.

Why use a remote repo than keep all the work local?
Well, the answer here is obvious. Keepig files in a cloud helps with collaboration. In addition, it is good backup,
ni case something drastic were to happen to the computer.

This is the second set of changes to the text3 file. It will be another commit with the 
title of second set of changes.

Pulling changes manually from GitHub makes more sense than having them update automatically.
This way I have control over when updates are made to my local system. The last thing
I would want is for my local files to update when I'm not expecting it.
